Based on the updated code, the README file for your "ExpressUserManager" application needs to reflect the shift from using a JSON file to MongoDB for data storage and management. Here's the updated README content:

```markdown
# ExpressUserManager

ExpressUserManager is a comprehensive user management API developed with Node.js and Express, now leveraging MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval. This upgrade from a simple JSON file (`MOCK_DATA.json`) to a robust NoSQL database enhances the application's capabilities, making it suitable for more complex and scalable applications.

## Features

- List all users from the MongoDB database.
- Retrieve a single user by ID from the database.
- Create a new user in the database.
- Update user information in the database.
- Delete a user from the database.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Required installations:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- NPM (bundled with Node.js)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

### Installation

Steps to set up your development environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ExpressUserManager.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd ExpressUserManager
   ```
3. Install NPM packages:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
